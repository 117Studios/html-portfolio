<h1>The Best Movies According to Kwasi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>A Few Good Men</h3>
<p>Not really sure what to say about this movie, everything about it is great from start to finish.</p>
<h3>In the mood for love</h3>

<p>this is one of my all time favorite movies, love the cinematography, each scene looks like a page from a high fashion editorial </p>
<h3>Hoodlum</h3>
<p>this is just a great movie that everyone one should see, Laurence Fishburn was at his best as BumpyJohnson, Tim Roth was pretty great as well...</p>
